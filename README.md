# IoTSim-Osmosis

<<<<<<< HEAD
IoTSim-Osmosis is a simulation framework that supports the testing and validation of osmotic computing applications. In particular, it enables a unified modelling and simulation of complex IoT applications over heterogeneous edge-cloud SDN-aware environments. A wide range of osmosis applications can be simulated and evaluated in IoTSim-Osmosis. For more information, read IoTSim-Osmosis_User_Manual.pdf.
